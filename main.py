Task 
For each stock on 19th April 2024 and 22nd April 2024, determine the timestamp when the
cumulative traded volume within a rolling 60-minute window first exceeds the stockâ€™s 30-day
average volume.

This 30-day average is calculated from the 30 trading days preceding the
trading day. If no crossover occurs during the day, the output for that stock should be None.
